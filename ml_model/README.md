# Housing Price Prediction Project

This project consists of two main components:

1. **ML Model**: A Python-based machine learning model for predicting housing prices in Bengaluru.
2. **Flutter App**: A mobile application that loads the exported ML model (in ONNX format) to perform predictions locally.

## Overview

The **ML Model** component trains a Linear Regression model using housing data (including features such as total_sqft, bath, balcony, and size) to predict house prices. After training, the model is saved using `joblib` and then converted to the ONNX format so that it can be embedded into a Flutter mobile application for offline inference.

The **Flutter App** loads the ONNX model from its assets and uses the `onnxruntime` package to perform predictions directly on the device.

## ML Model Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required packages using:
  ```bash
  pip install -r ml_model/requirements.txt
  ```
  **`requirements.txt`** includes:
  ```
  pandas
  numpy
  scikit-learn
  joblib
  matplotlib
  seaborn
  skl2onnx
  onnx
  ```

### Data Preparation

- Place your dataset (`Bengaluru_House_Data.csv`) in the `ml_model/data/` folder.
- The dataset should include columns such as `total_sqft`, `bath`, `balcony`, `size`, and `price`.
- The script handles data cleaning (removing missing values and converting text columns to numeric).

### Training the Model

- Run the training script from the `ml_model` folder:
  ```bash
  python train_model.py
  ```
- This script:
  - Loads and cleans the dataset.
  - Trains a Linear Regression model.
  - Evaluates the model (calculates MAE and RMSE).
  - Saves the trained model (`house_price_model.pkl`) and scaler (`scaler.pkl`).
  - Generates visualization charts for data distribution, feature relationships, and prediction performance.

### Converting the Model to ONNX

- After training, convert the model to ONNX format:
  ```bash
  python convert_to_onnx.py
  ```
- This will create `house_price_model.onnx` which is used in the Flutter app.
- Copy the `house_price_model.onnx` file into the `flutter_app/assets/` folder.

---

## Flutter App Setup

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed.
- Ensure the following dependencies are in your `pubspec.yaml` (in addition to default Flutter packages):
  ```yaml
  dependencies:
    flutter:
      sdk: flutter
    onnxruntime: ^0.3.0  # or latest version
  ```

### Integrating the ONNX Model

- The ONNX model file is placed under `flutter_app/assets/house_price_model.onnx`.
- The app loads this model using the `onnxruntime` package.
- In your Dart code (e.g., in `predict.dart`), you should:
  - Load the model from assets.
  - Prepare input data (as a list of floats corresponding to the model's features).
  - Run inference using ONNX runtime and retrieve the predicted price.

### Running the App

- Navigate to the `flutter_app` folder:
  ```bash
  cd flutter_app
  ```
- Run the Flutter app:
  ```bash
  flutter run
  ```

## Notes

- Ensure that your CSV dataset is clean and properly formatted as expected by the training script.
- If you update the ML model (change features or architecture), remember to update the Flutter app accordingly (input dimensions, preprocessing, etc.).
- The Flutter app performs predictions offline, so any changes in the model require a new conversion to ONNX and updating the asset file.
